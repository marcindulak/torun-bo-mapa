# Implementation overview

The frontend is a static HTML application with embedded JavaScript using ES modules, hosted on Github Pages.
The data originates from https://bip.torun.pl/artykuly/32484/budzet-torunia, and is to be saved manually under the `noupload` folder.
The saved files are cleaned and curated using Python scripts located in the `preprocessing` folder.
The outcome of the preprocessing steps is a file in JSON format, that is embedded verbatim in the `index.html` file for CORS compatibility.
The visualization uses Leaflet to place budget markers on an OpenStreetMap.

# Abandoned ideas

- Loading data from separate JSON files: discarded due to CORS restrictions when opening HTML files directly in browsers.
- Using a web server to serve the application: discarded to avoid hosting requirements.
