# Functionality overview

Visualization of the budget of the city of Toru≈Ñ, Poland.

# Usage examples

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/marcindulak/torun-budzet-wizualizacja
   cd torun-budzet-wizualizacja
   ```

3. Fetch machine learning models (this needs to be performed only once):

   ```
   uv add --no-deps 'pl-core-news-sm @ https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/pl_core_news_sm-3.8.0/pl_core_news_sm-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl'
   ```

4. Install Python dependencies:

   ```
   uv sync
   ```

5. Extract budget data from PDF:

   ```
   uv run python preprocessing/extract_budzet_obywatelski_2024.py
   ```

# Running tests

Tests run inside Docker containers to have access to required dependencies.

## Unit tests

```
bash scripts/test_unit.sh
```

## Integration test

End-to-end test verifies the overall functionality the the user perspective:

```
bash scripts/test_e2e.sh
```

## Type checking

Run mypy static type checking:

```
bash scripts/test_mypy.sh
```

# Implementation overview

The frontend is a static HTML application with embedded JavaScript using ES modules, hosted on Github Pages.
The data originates from https://bip.torun.pl/artykuly/32484/budzet-torunia, and is to be saved manually under the `noupload` folder.
The saved files are cleaned and curated using Python scripts located in the `preprocessing` folder.
The outcome of the preprocessing steps is a file in JSON format, that is embedded verbatim in the `index.html` file for CORS compatibility.
The visualization uses Leaflet to place budget markers on an OpenStreetMap.

# Abandoned ideas

- Loading data from separate JSON files: discarded due to CORS restrictions when opening HTML files directly in browsers.
- Using a web server to serve the application: discarded to avoid hosting requirements.
